Integrating the homogeneous heat equation using centered finite difference approximations. 

This program approximates the solution to the heat equation through numerical integration over a grid, given an initial condition of a sine wave at time t = 0. Through use of the centered finite difference approximations of the first and second derivative, an update to the heat equation solution u(x,t) is achieved for forward steps in time.
